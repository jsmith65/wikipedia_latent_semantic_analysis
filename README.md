Natural Language Processing with Latent Semantic Analysis in Python

This was my final project for Linear Algebra taken Fall 2024 at Tennessee State University.

Used term frequency-inverse documument frequency to weight the term-document matrix.
Performed a singular value decomposition on the resulting matrix.
Truncated the resulting matrix factors by a given constant k.
The matrix factors are then clustered using cosine similarity and k-means.
After clustering the factors a multiplied back together and a term-document matrix is produced with like terms and like documents clustered together.

See final report paper for details.
